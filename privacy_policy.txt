# Privacy Policy for Quick Gmail Reply

Effective Date: [Insert Date, e.g., April 28, 2025]

## Introduction
Quick Gmail Reply ("the Extension") is a browser extension developed by [Your Name or Company] to automate email replies in Gmail by filling reply boxes with user-defined templates and optionally attaching a resume file. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension handles data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and do not collect, store, or share personal information.

## Data Handling
The Extension operates entirely within your browser and does not transmit data to external servers. Below is how the Extension interacts with data:

- **Local Storage**: The Extension stores the following user-provided settings locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`:
  - Auto-reply mode status (enabled/disabled)
  - Email reply template
  - Resume file data (temporarily, for attachment purposes)
  - Resume file name
  These settings are stored on your device and are not sent to any external servers.

- **Gmail Interaction**: The Extension accesses Gmail’s webpage content to:
  - Detect email threads and reply boxes.
  - Extract recipient names from email headers for personalizing replies.
  - Attach resume files to email drafts.
  This data is processed in real-time within your browser and is not stored or transmitted.

- **Resume Files**: If you choose to attach a resume, the Extension temporarily processes the file to facilitate attachment in Gmail. The resume data is not stored after the attachment process or shared with any third parties.

## No Data Collection or Sharing
The Extension does not:
- Collect personal information (e.g., names, email addresses, or email content) for storage or transmission.
- Share any data with third parties.
- Use analytics or tracking technologies.
- Connect to external servers.

## Permissions

- **Storage**: To save your settings (e.g., email template, auto-reply mode) locally.
- **ActiveTab**: To interact with Gmail’s webpage content.
- **Scripting**: To execute scripts that automate replies and attachments in Gmail.
These permissions are used solely to provide the Extension’s functionality and do not involve data collection or transmission.

## User Responsibilities
You are responsible for:
- Ensuring the content of your email templates and attached resumes complies with applicable laws and Gmail’s terms of service.
- Reviewing this Privacy Policy before using the Extension.
